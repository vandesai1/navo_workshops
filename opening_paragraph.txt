NASA missions have collected a lot (XXX) of data spanning a large range (XXX) in wavelengths. These data are housed in four different archives: the HEASARC, MAST, IRSA, NED. However, different physical locations are not an obstacle for astronomers doing multiwavelength science projects that need to make use of data from different archives. The archives have been working together to make sure that you don’t need to know too much about us to get the data you need to work together. We’ve done this by standardizing the way that programs can access the data we house. Since python is a very popular programming language, we are going to use it to show you how you can take advantage of this standardization to put together and analyze a multiwavelength data set. For this workshop, we are using a sample of interacting galaxies, and we will assemble a multiwavelength data set for it. You can generalize this example to much larger data sets of your own.
