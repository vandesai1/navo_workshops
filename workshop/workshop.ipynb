    "NASA missions have collected a huge amount of data spanning a large range in wavelengths. These data are housed in four different archives: the HEASARC, MAST, IRSA, NED. However, different physical locations are not an obstacle for astronomers doing multiwavelength science projects that need to make use of data from different archives. The archives have been working together to make sure that you don’t need to know too much about us to get the data you need to work together. We’ve done this by standardizing the way that programs can access the data we house. Since python is a very popular programming language, we are going to use it to show you how you can take advantage of this standardization to put together and analyze a multiwavelength data set. For this workshop, we are using a sample of interacting galaxies, and we will assemble a multiwavelength data set for it. You can generalize this example to much larger data sets of your own."

This achieves an 80,000-fold improvement in sensitivity relative to earlier surveys. 2MASS used two new, highly-automated 1.3-m telescopes, one at Mt. Hopkins, AZ, and one at CTIO, Chile. Each telescope is equipped with a three-channel camera, each channel consisting of a 256 by 256 array of HgCdTe detectors, capable of observing the sky simultaneously at J (1.25 microns), H (1.65 microns), and K&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;s&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; (2.17 microns). &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;2MASS images and other data products can be obtained at the &amp;lt;a href=\"http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/applications/2MASS/QL/\"&amp;gt;NASA/IPAC Infrared Science Archive&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;          https://skyview.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/sia.pl?survey=2mass&amp;                               https://skyview.gsfc.nasa.gov\n",

SkyView currently includes surveys from the four bands of the FIS instrument: N60, WIDE-S, WIDE-L and N160. &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; These surveys cover 99% of the sky in four photometric bands centred at 65µm, 90µm, 140µm, and 160µm, with spatial resolutions ranging from 1-1.5'. &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; These data provide crucial information on the investigation and characterisation of the proper- ties of dusty material in the interstellar medium (ISM), since a significant portion of its energy is emitted between ~50 and 200 µm. The large-scale distribution of interstellar clouds, their thermal dust temperatures, and their column densities can be investigated with the improved spatial resolution compared to earlier all-sky survey observations. In addition to the point source distribution, the large-scale distribution of ISM cirrus emis- sion, and its filamentary structure, are well traced. &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; Data are obtained using using the &amp;lt;a href=http://jvo.nao.ac.jp/index-e.html&amp;gt;JVO &amp;lt;a&amp;gt;AKARI Simple Image Access Service.          https://skyview.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/sia.pl?survey=akari&amp;                               https://skyview.gsfc.nasa.gov\n",

The final status of an observation is given by the parameter Status. Specific dates that affect the status of an observation are listed as the parameters scheduled_date, observed_date, processed_date, archived_date, and cycle. Notice that, if one or more of the date parameters are empty for a given observation, this means that that those particular processes have not occurred: e.g., if observed_date is empty, this means that the planned observation was not observed.           https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/xamin/vo/sia?table=ascamaster&amp;  https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/ascamaster.html\n",

It contains source and background events files, spectra, ancillary response files and response matrices, images, and assorted light curves for a large number of ASCA AGN observations. Spectral fit results are done by automatic XSPEC fitting. This database table allows easy access to reduced AGN data for the whole community, allowing the maximum scientific return from the data. Availability of publishable light curves, images, and spectra (which can also be readily re-fitted) should be particularly valuable to astronomers with little direct experience in the reduction of X-ray data. Version 3.1 has been created by analyzing all ASCA observing sequences with targets designated as AGN, as indicated by a leading &amp;quot;7&amp;quot; in the ASCA observing sequence number. Version 3.1 contains products for all 611 observing sequences designated as AGN observations. This is a significant improvement over Versions 1 and 2. Moreover, the 611 sequences for which products are available are complete in the sense that either the target object was not detected (in which case an upper limit on GIS2 source counts is given) or the intended AGN target was detected and the data were fully analyzed. In order to obtain the most accurate background subtraction and minimize contamination from any nearby sources, version 3.1 makes more use of custom extraction regions than previous versions. It is expected that version 3.1 will be replaced when the final ASCA calibration is completed.             https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/xamin/vo/sia?table=tartarus&amp;    https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/tartarus.html\n",

This catalog was generated by searching for point-like sources in all data available from the HEASARC's ASCA PUBLIC archive (ASCAPUBLIC) as of 24 Oct 1996; and is populated by both target and serendipitous sources in the SIS field-of-view. For each cataloged source various information is available, which includes the celestial coordinates of the source, the count rate, the significance of detection, and the hardness ratio, total aperture counts, exposure time, and start time of the observation. In addition, a set of three GIF &amp;quot;thumbnail&amp;quot; images is available in the broad (0.5 - 12 keV), soft (2 &amp;lt; keV), and hard (&amp;gt; 2 keV) spectral bands centered on the apparent detection. These images are convenient for accessing the quality of the source detection. The current catalog is preliminary, the goal of the catalog authors being to make the SIS source list available as quickly as possible. To accomplish this, they took an incremental approach and placed their &amp;quot;work in progress&amp;quot; on-line, warts and all.

Swift/BAT is a wide field-of-view (70x100 degrees) hard X-ray imager consisting of a coded mask and large array of CdZnTe detectors (5000 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). The primary purpose of BAT is the detection gamma-ray bursts and the BAT survey data is collected during the search for gamma-ray bursts. &lt;p&gt; BAT is sensitive in the energy range 14-195 keV. The data from the first 9 months of the survey is divided into 4 energy channels: 14-24, 24-50, 50-100, and 100-195 keV. Each of these is represented as separate survey, and an averaged survey over all bands is also given. &lt;p&gt; The all sky maps are presented in two forms, the significance maps and the flux maps. The significance maps are the count rate divided by the noise (sigma RMS) in a region of the map around the position. The noise is variable across the sky due to variable exposure and systematic noise. The noise is Gaussian and and the significances can be interpreted with the usual Gaussian probabilities. A threshold of 4.8 sigma for the blind detection of sources in the BAT survey corresponds to about 1 false detection on the whole sky. &lt;p&gt; The BAT flux map is scaled from the Crab rate in the survey and normalized to an assumed Crab spectrum of 10.4 E&lt;sup&gt;-2.15&lt;/sup&gt; photons.cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/sec/keV. Due to the large number of randomly distributed gamma-ray burst pointings that contribute to any point in the image, this is an accurate characterization for the whole sky. The 4.8 sigma threshold in the 9-month survey covers 80% of the sky at flux threshold of 3.5x10&lt;sup&gt;-11&lt;/sup&gt; ergs/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/s in the 14-195 keV band and covers 1/3 of the sky near the ecliptic poles at 2.5x10&lt;sup&gt;-11&lt;/sup&gt; ergs/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/s.         https://skyview.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/sia.pl?survey=batsig&amp;                               https://skyview.gsfc.nasa.gov\n",

The mapping pattern was designed to uniformly cover the 30'x30' extent of the ECDFS, centered on 03:32:29.0, -27:48:47.0 (J2000). The project used a total of 310 hrs of observations to achieve a beam-smoothed noise of 1.2 mJy/beam over 900 sq. arcmin (and &amp;lt; 1 .6mJy/beam over 1260 sq. arcmin).

It also includes scheduled and as-yet-not-scheduled targets. The HEASARC updates this database table on a twice-weekly basis by querying the database table at the Chandra X-Ray Center (CXC) website, as discussed in the Provenance section. For observations whose status is 'archived', data products can be retrieved from the HEASARC's mirror of the CXC's Chandra Data Archive (CDA). The CXC should be acknowledged as the source of Chandra data. The PVC phase was during the first few months of the CXO mission; some of the calibration observations that are for monitoring purposes will be performed in later mission cycles. All calibration data (entries with Type = CAL in this database) are placed immediately into the CXO public data archive at the Chandra X-Ray Observatory Center (CXC); please see the Web page at http://asc.harvard.edu/ for more information on the CXC data archive). GTO observations during Cycle 1 or any subsequent Cycle will probably occupy 100% of months 3-4, 30% of months 5-22, and 15% of the available time for the remainder of the mission. Guaranteed Time Observers will have the same proprietary data rights as General Observers (i.e., their data will be placed in the public CXC archive 12 months after they have received the data in usable form).

The survey consists of 488,000 spectra that Nyquist or beamwidth (1/8 deg) sample the entire Galactic plane over a strip 4 deg-10 deg wide in latitude, and beamwidth or 1/4 deg sample nearly all large local clouds at higher latitudes. Compared with the previous composite CO survey of Dame et al. (1987), the new survey has 16 times more spectra, up to 3.4 times higher angular resolution, and up to 10 times higher sensitivity per unit solid angle. &amp;lt;P&amp;gt; Users should be aware that both the angular resolution and the sensitivity varies from region to region in the velocity-integrated map. The component surveys were integrated individually using clipping or moment masking in order to display nearly all statistically significant emission but little noise above a level of ~1.5 K km/s.

SkyView has supported three maps: an early averaged map including including zodiacal and Galactic components (COBE DIRBE (OLD)), a more recent cleaner version of that data (COBE DIRBE/AAM) and a map with the zodaical light subtracted out (COBE DIRBE/ZSMA). The early data is no longer supported. Please contact us if you want access to these data. &lt;P&gt; Detailed descriptions of the DIRBE, the data processing, and the data products are given in an Explanatory Supplement. A Small Source Spectral Energy Distribution Browser can be used to assess the visibility of an unresolved or small extended source in the DIRBE data and see its spectral energy distribution. As noted in section 5.6.6 of the Explanatory Supplement, the DIRBE Time-ordered Data are required to derive definitive point source fluxes. &lt;p&gt; These maps provide an estimate of the infrared intensity at each pixel and wavelength band based on an interpolation of the observations made at various times at solar elongations close to 90&amp;amp;amp;#176;. &lt;P&gt; These COBE DIRBE maps are a combination original ten band passes with the following wavelengths: &lt;UL&gt; &lt;LI&gt;Band 1 - 1.25 &amp;amp;amp;#181;m &lt;LI&gt;Band 2 - 2.2 &amp;amp;amp;#181;m &lt;LI&gt;Band 3 - 3.5 &amp;amp;amp;#181;m &lt;LI&gt;Band 4 - 4.9 &amp;amp;amp;#181;m &lt;LI&gt;Band 5 - 12 &amp;amp;amp;#181;m &lt;LI&gt;Band 6 - 25 &amp;amp;amp;#181;m &lt;li&gt;Band 7 - 60 &amp;amp;amp;#181;m &lt;li&gt;Band 8 - 100 &amp;amp;amp;#181;m &lt;li&gt;Band 9 - 140 &amp;amp;amp;#181;m &lt;li&gt;Band 10 - 240 &amp;amp;amp;#181;m &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt; The default two dimensional array uses Band 8 (100 &amp;amp;amp;#181;m). &lt;P&gt; The COBE DIRBE/Annual Average Maps (AAM) is the cumulative weighted average of the photometry. This average is calculated using the weighted number of observations from each Weekly Averaged Map ( WtNumObs from the Weekly Averaged Map) as the weight, such that annual_average =sum( weekly_average * weekly_weight )/ sum( weekly_weight ) &lt;p&gt; COBE DIRBE/Zodi-Subtracted Mission Average (ZSMA) Skymap represents the extra-Solar system sky brightness. It is the average residual map that results after the modelled interplanetary dust (IPD) signal is subtracted from each of the DIRBE Weekly Skymaps from the cryogenic mission. Individual weekly residual maps can be reconstructed from the data supplied in the DIRBE Sky and Zodi Atlas (DSZA).           https://skyview.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/sia.pl?survey=cobe&amp;                               https://skyview.gsfc.nasa.gov\n",

Data is broken into 5 energy bands &amp;lt;ul&amp;gt; &amp;lt;li&amp;gt; 30-100 MeV Band 1 &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt; &amp;lt;li&amp;gt; 100-300 MeV Band 2 &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt; &amp;lt;li&amp;gt; 300-1000 MeV Band 3 &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt; &amp;lt;li&amp;gt; 1-3 GeV Band 4 &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt; &amp;lt;li&amp;gt; 3-300 GeV Band 5 &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt; The SkyView data are based upon a Cartesian projection of the counts divided by the exposure maps. In the Cartesian projection pixels near the pole have a much smaller area than pixels on the equator, so these pixels have smaller integrated flux. When creating large scale images in other projections users may wish to make sure to compensate for this effect the flux conserving clip-resampling option.          https://skyview.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/sia.pl?survey=fermi&amp;                               https://skyview.gsfc.nasa.gov\n",

The GALEX instrument allows imaging and spectroscopic observations to be made in two ultraviolet bands, Far UV (FUV) 1350-1780A and Near UV (NUV) 1770-2730A. The instrument provides simultaneous co-aligned FUV and NUV images with spatial resolution 4.3 and 5.3 arcseconds respectively. Details of the performance of the instrument and detectors can be found in Morrissey et al. (2007) ApJS, 173, 682. &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; The &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;SkyView&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; GALEX surveys mosaic the intensity images of All-Sky Survey images. For a given pixel only the nearest image is used. Since a given GALEX observation is circular, this maximizes the coverage compared with default image finding algorithms which use the distance from edge of the image. &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; As of February 10, 2011 SkyView uses the GR6 data release for the entire sky.       https://skyview.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/sia.pl?survey=galexfar&amp;                               https://skyview.gsfc.nasa.gov\n",

Each pointing is centred on a massive galaxy (M&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;*&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; &amp;gt; 1011 M&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;sun&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;) in the redshift range 1.7 &amp;lt; z &amp;lt; 3 , selected by their optical-to-infrared colours (Papovich+06,Yan+04,Daddi+07) from the GOODS (Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey) fields. &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; The positions of the 60 GNS pointings were optimised to contain as many massive galaxies as possible and are partly overlapping, covering a total area of about 45 arcmin2. The field of view of the NICMOS-3 camera is 51.2 × 51.2 arcsec with a resolution of about 0.1 arcsec/pixel. The PSF has a width of about 0.3 arcsec FWHM. The limiting magnitude in H band reached at 5s is HAB = 26.8, about 2 magnitudes fainter than in available ground based data of the GOODS fields.

C. Cesarsky) which have been obtained in service mode observations between August 2004 and fall 2006. The 1-sigma depth for VIMOS U band in the area covered by the GOODS-ACS observations is ~30 AB (within an aperture of 1\" radius, ranging from 29.5 and 30.2 AB). The PSF of the VIMOS U band mosaic is ~0.8\" FWHM, but varies over the field. &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; Also included in this data release is a coadded image in R band obtained from data retrieved from the ESO archive. Due to the different observing strategies adopted in the programmes the resulting coverage of the GOODS-ACS area is more complex than for the U band. The depth of the VIMOS R band mosaic over the ACS area ranges from ~28 AB to 29 AB (1-sigma, 1\" aperture radius). The PSF of the VIMOS R band mosaic is ~0\".7 FWHM and varies over the field.

One of the main instruments of the observatory was the French-Soviet hard X-ray coded mask telescope SIGMA (Paul et al.1 1991, Adv.Space Res., 11, 279). It was the first space telescope that used coded aperture technique for reconstruction of sky images in hard X-rays (35-1300 keV). The angular resolution of the telescope was approximately 12' and the accuracy of a source localization is approximately 2-3'.&lt;p&gt; SIGMA discovered numerious interesting hard X-ray sources including GRS 1758-258, which is located only 40' from bright soft X-ray source GX 5-1. It detected hard X-ray flux from X-ray burster A1742-294, which is very near to bright black hole binary 1E1740.7-2942. SIGMA set an upper limit on the hard X-ray flux of from the central supermassive black hole in our Galaxy.&lt;p&gt; During the period 1990-1998 SIGMA observed more that one quarter of the sky with sensitivity better than 100 mCrab. The Galactic Center region had the deepest exposure ( approximately 9 million sec), with the sensitivity to a source discovery (S/N &amp;amp;gt; ~ 5) or approximately 10 mCrab.&lt;p&gt; A list of all detected sources with references to publications on them is presented in the paper of Revnivtsev et al. 2004, Astr. Lett. v.6. In these survey images (40-100 keV) all performed observations are averaged together. Transient sources that were discovered by SIGMA may not visible in the averaged image. &lt;p&gt; This survey has some features that users should keep in mind. The SIGMA telescope is a complicated instrument and is strongly dominated by the accuracy of the background subtraction. The presence of a very bright source in the field of view of the telescope sometimes can not be fully accounted for and as a result of it some 'ghost' sources can appear. Such features can be seen in the regions near very bright sources like Crab Nebula, Cyg X-1, Nova Per 1992, Nova Mus 1991, Nova Oph 1993, and in the Galactic Center region. In addition to its nominal field of view (~17x17 deg) located around the optical axis of the telescope, SIGMA had another window of relatively high transparency of its shield, approximately 20-30&amp;amp;amp;#176; apart from the optical axis. Becuase of this a very bright sources like Cyg X-1 can cause non zero illumination of the SIGMA detector if they are located approximately 20-30&amp;amp;amp;#176; from the optical axis. The ring-like features caused by this effect, can be seen around Cyg X-1, and Nova Per 1992. &lt;p&gt; The count rate of detected sources (or upper limits) can be roughly translated into mCrab using the fact that that Crab nebula gives the count rate approximately 2.8e&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt; cnts/s in the units, provided in 'flux' maps         https://skyview.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/sia.pl?survey=granat&amp;                               https://skyview.gsfc.nasa.gov\n",

The data was distributed in the NRAO Images from the Radio Sky CD ROM. &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; The original 287x101 tiles had only 1 pixel overlap. To allow higher order resampling, the data were retiled into two hemisphere files of 1726x600 pixels with an overlap of 10 pixels. &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; The southernmost tiles were only 287x100 pixels.

Certain gaps and streaks in the image have been fixed by interpolating over the the gap. Typically these gaps are no more than a pixel or two wide. A brief description of the satellite and the data analysis follows. The map used in &amp;lt;i&amp;gt; SkyView &amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; is the map designated &amp;lt;tt&amp;gt; 322_15_tot_ecl_samp.img&amp;lt;/tt&amp;gt; in the &amp;lt;a href=ftp://legacy.gsfc.nasa.gov/heao1/data/a2/maps/heasarc_med_hed&amp;gt; HEASARC FTP area&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. Many other maps are available. These differ in epoch, resolution, energy band, coordinate system and projection, and sampling methods. Details are given in the README file in the archive. &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; See Allen, Jahoda, and Whitlock (1994) for full details about the available maps, their processing, and methods for converting the map intensities into familiar physical units.         https://skyview.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/sia.pl?survey=heao1a&amp;                               https://skyview.gsfc.nasa.gov\n",

Data were mosaicked into 1.1 degree tiles by SkyView. Exposure maps were generated for each HRI observation using the hriexpmap FTOOL. For each tile, all observations that might contribute to that tile were located and added to count and exposure map tiles. Exposures for each observation were calculated using a nearest neighbor interpolation of the center of the tile pixels to the exposure map pixels. Counts were computed by projecting the RA and Decs of each eligible photon into the appropriate tile pixel. Only photons with a PHA &amp;amp;gt; 3 were included in the mosaic and within each observation only counts within the region where the exposure was greater than half the maximum exposure were included.            https://skyview.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/sia.pl?survey=hri&amp;                               https://skyview.gsfc.nasa.gov\n",

The spectrograph SPI (Vedrenne et al. 2003, A&amp;amp;amp;A, 411, L63) consists of 19 Germanium detectors and is capable of imaging in the 20 - 8000 keV band because of a coded mask. Part of the core program of the INTEGRAL mission is a study of the Galactic Centre, the Galactic Centre Deep Exposure (GCDE).&amp;lt;p&amp;gt; The SPI significance map is based on the public GCDE data and uses data in the 20 - 40 keV energy range. The analysis of the data was done using the SPIROS software (Skinner &amp;amp;amp; Connell 2003, A&amp;amp;amp;A, 411, L123). This software uses the 'Iterative Removal of Sources' technique in order to find the most significant sources. In the output significance map the sources found in this process are put on top of the residual map as points with a FWHM of 1 degree. &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; Current data respresent the combination of all public observations as of September 1, 2004. https://skyview.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/sia.pl?survey=integralspi_gc&amp;                               https://skyview.gsfc.nasa.gov\n",

A total of 135 megaseconds of exposure is included in the observations used. Survey data is generated for the Galactic plane in the region |b| &amp;lt;= 17.5. The original flux data has been convolved with 5' seeing kernel. To minimize loss of resolution in transformations, the Lanczos sampler is suggested as the default, but may be overriden by the user.

Further details of the survey construction are given in the reference. &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; The flux and significance maps use the PSF convolved maps from the survey. The flux maps are in millicrab units. Exposure maps (with exposures in seconds) were from the exposure extension in the MAPDLD files and give the dead-time corrected exposure in seconds. &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; Links to the exposure and significance maps corresponding to the requested region will be given in the Web output. These maps can be generated directly in the CLI interface. For each waveband the flux, significance and exposure maps are available with just the end of the survey names distinguishing them (e.g., INT Gal 17-35 [Flux|Sig|Exp] or INTGal1735[F|S|E])         https://skyview.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/sia.pl?survey=intgal&amp;                               https://skyview.gsfc.nasa.gov\n",

Data from the four IRAS bands are shown as individual surveys in SkyView. Users should be aware that IPAC does not encourage the use of data near the ecliptic plane as they feel that contribution from local cirrus emission is significant. &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; The data are distributed in sets of 430 maps. Each map covers approximately 12.5x12.5 degrees, and the map centers are offset by 5 degrees so that there is a 2.5 degree overlap. IPAC has processed to a uniform standard so that excellent mosaics of the maps can be made. Users should be cautious of data in saturated regions. Known problems in the analysis mean that data values are unlikely to be correct. Note that IPAC has optimized the processing of these data for features of 5' or more although the resolution of the data is closer to the 1.5' pixel size. &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; There are occasional pixels in the IRAS maps which are given as NULL values. Unless these are explicitly trapped by user software, these data will appear as large negative values. SkyView ignores these pixels when determining the color scale to display an image. &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; Essentially the entire sky is covered by the survey. However there are a few regions not surveyed and the data values in these regions are suspect. These are given to users as delivered from IPAC.           https://skyview.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/sia.pl?survey=iras&amp;                               https://skyview.gsfc.nasa.gov\n",

This new generation of IRAS images, called IRIS, benefits from a better zodiacal light subtraction, from a calibration and zero level compatible with DIRBE, and from a better destriping. At 100 micron the IRIS product is also a significant improvement from the Schlegel et al. (1998) maps. IRIS keeps the full ISSA resolution, it includes well calibrated point sources and the diffuse emission calibration at scales smaller than 1 degree was corrected for the variation of the IRAS detector responsivity with scale and brightness. The uncertainty on the IRIS calibration and zero level are dominated by the uncertainty on the DIRBE calibration and on the accuracy of the zodiacal light model. &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; More information about the IRIS dataset is available at &amp;lt;a href=http://www.cita.utoronto.ca/~mamd/IRIS&amp;gt; the IRIS Web site&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; whence most of the preceding description came.           https://skyview.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/sia.pl?survey=iris&amp;                               https://skyview.gsfc.nasa.gov\n",

A fuller description is available at the &lt;a href=\"http://home.arcor.de/axel.mellinger/\"&gt;survey web site&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;p&gt; Between October 2007 and August 2009 a digital all-sky mosaic was assembled from more than 3000 individual CCD frames. Using an SBIG STL-11000 camera, 70 fields (each covering 40x27 degrees) were imaged from dark-sky locations in South Africa, Texas and Michigan. In order to increase the dynamic range beyond the 16 bits of the camera's analog-to-digital converter (of which approximately 12 bits provide data above the noise leve) three different exposure times (240s, 15s and 0.5 s) were used. Five frames were taken for each exposure time and filter setting. The frames were photometrically calibrated using standard catalog stars and sky background data from the Pioneer 10 and 11 space probes. the panorama has an image scale of 36\"/pixel and a limiting magnitude of approximately 14. The survey has an 18 bit dynamic range. &lt;p&gt; The processing of these data used a custom data pipeline built using IRAF, Source Extractor and SWarp. &lt;p&gt; The data used here were converted to three independent RGB color planes of 8 bits each and provided to SkyView as a single 36000x18000x3 Cartesian projection cube. To allow users to efficiently sample data in a region of the sky, this cube was broken up into 2100x2100 pixel regions with a 50 pixel overlap between adjacent images. Tiles at the poles were 2100x2050. &lt;p&gt; In &lt;i&gt;SkyView&lt;/i&gt; each color plane comprises a survey. The individual planes may be sampled as surveys independently as Mellinger-R, Mellinger-G and Mellinger-B. The color mosaics can be regenerated by creating an RGB image of all three surveys. Since &lt;i&gt;SkyView&lt;/i&gt; may stretch the intensity values within each color, linear scaling and a minimum of 0 and maximum of 255 should be specified to keep the original intensity scalings. &lt;p&gt; The full spatial resolution data is used for images of less than 30 degrees on a side. If a user requests a larger region, data are sampled from a lower resolution 3600x1800x3 data cube. Please contact the survey author if you need to use the higher resolution data for larger regions.

NEAT is designed to look for potentially hazardous asteroids, i.e., those whose orbits cross the Earth's. Over 200,000 images are available in the NEAT archive. &amp;lt;a href=http://skys.gsfc.nasa.gov/skymorph/skymorph.html&amp;gt;SkyMorph&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; provides a Web interface to the NEAT images and allows users to select all images in which a given fixed or moving object is found. &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; Unlike most &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;SkyView&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; surveys, the NEAT data are extremely irregular in their spatial distribution. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;SkyView&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;'s algorithms for mosaicking images together to form large images are not adequate for the NEAT data, so mosaicking is surpressed. Only data within a single NEAT image will be displayed. The system attempts to find the most recent image within which has a offset in both RA and Dec of less than 0.8 degrees. If no such image is found, then an image with the minimum offset is returned, or the search may fail altogether if there are no nearby plates. The NEAT telescope uses an array of 4 CCDs. The backgrounds of the CCDs may differ significantly. &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; The NEAT survey covers approximately 30% of the sky. Extreme southern and low-Galactic latitude regions are unsurveyed. Coverage is otherwise particularly dense in the ecliptic plane. &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; NEAT data consists primarily of groups of three images taken with separations of 20 minutes and almost identical positions. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt; SkyView &amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; will normally return the last of a 'triplet'. The SkyMorph site can be used to display an overlay of triplets to look for targets which moved during the interval between images. &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; A catalog of objects detected in the NEAT/SkyMorph pages is accessible through the SkyMorph pages. 'Light-curves' from all images during which an object was in the NEAT field of view can also be generated. &amp;lt;P&amp;gt; The NEAT data values are in arbitrary density units. To enhance the display data are transformed such that all pixels below the median values are scaled linearly to values 0-20, while all pixels above the median are shifted (but not scaled) to values greater than 20.           https://skyview.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/sia.pl?survey=neat&amp;                               https://skyview.gsfc.nasa.gov\n",

NuSTAR operates in the band from 3 to 79 keV, extending the sensitivity of focusing far beyond the ~10 keV high-energy cutoff achieved by all previous X-ray satellites. The inherently low background associated with concentrating the X-ray light enables NuSTAR to probe the hard X-ray sky with a more than 100-fold improvement in sensitivity over the collimated or coded mask instruments that have operated in this bandpass. Using its unprecedented combination of sensitivity and spatial and spectral resolution, NuSTAR will pursue five primary scientific objectives: (1) probe obscured active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity out to the peak epoch of galaxy assembly in the universe (at z &amp;lt;~ 2) by surveying selected regions of the sky; (2) study the population of hard X-ray-emitting compact objects in the Galaxy by mapping the central regions of the Milky Way; (3) study the non-thermal radiation in young supernova remnants, both the hard X-ray continuum and the emission from the radioactive element 44 Ti; (4) observe blazars contemporaneously with ground-based radio, optical, and TeV telescopes, as well as with Fermi and Swift, to constrain the structure of AGN jets; and (5) observe line and continuum emission from core-collapse supernovae in the Local Group, and from nearby Type Ia events, to constrain explosion models. During its baseline two-year mission, NuSTAR will also undertake a broad program of targeted observations. The observatory consists of two co-aligned grazing-incidence X-ray telescopes pointed at celestial targets by a three-axis stabilized spacecraft. Deployed into a 600-km, near-circular, 6 o inclination orbit, the observatory is performing consistent with pre-launch expectations. NuSTAR is now completing its primary science mission, and with an expected orbit lifetime of 10 yr, the opportunity for proposing observations as part of the guest observer program is now available, with observations beginning in 2015. This table contains a list of (a) unobserved targets that are planned or have been accepted for observation by NuSTAR in the future and (b) NuSTAR observations which have been processed and successfully validated by the NuSTAR Science Operation Center. The data from these observations may or may not be public. The user should check the value of the public_date parameter to determine the status of a specified data set: only those ObsIDs which have a public_date in the past will have data publicly available. Observations with a public_date parameter value which is either blank or a date in the future are still considered proprietary. Such data sets have been ingested into the HEASARC archive but will remain encrypted until their public date. Entries with status set to accepted are targets approved for scheduling with a planned exposure time given in the exposure_a (and exposure_b) parameter as a negative value.             https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/xamin/vo/sia?table=numaster&amp;    https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/numaster.html\n",

These maps were made with a relatively large restoring beam (45 arcsec FWHM) to yield the high surface-brightness sensitivity needed for completeness and photometric accuracy. Their rms brightness fluctuations are about 0.45 mJy/beam = 0.14 K (Stokes I) and 0.29 mJy/beam = 0.09 K (Stokes Q and U).

Planck provides all-sky survey data at all nine frequencies with higher resolution at the 6 higher frequencies. It provides substantially higher resolution and sensitivity than WMAP. Planck orbits in the L2 Lagrange point. These data come from Release 1 of the Planck mission. &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; The original data are stored in HEALPix pixels. SkyView treats HEALPix as a standard projection but assumes that the HEALPix data is in a projection plane with a rotation of -45 degrees. The rotation transforms the HEALPix pixels from diamonds to squares so that the boundaries of the pixels are treated properly. The special HealPixImage class is used so that SkyView can use the HEALPix FITS files directly. The HealPixImage simulates a rectangular image but translates the pixels from that image to the nested HEALPix structure that is used by the HEALPix data. Users of the SkyView Jar will be able to access this survey through the web but performance may be poor since the FITS files are 150 to 600 MB in size and must be completely read in. SkyView will not automatically cache these files on the user machine as is done for non-HEALPix surveys. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; Data from the frequencies of 100 GHz or higher are stored in a HEALPix file with a resolution of approximately 1.7' while lower frequencies are stored with half that resolution, approximately 3.4'.         https://skyview.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/sia.pl?survey=planck&amp;                               https://skyview.gsfc.nasa.gov\n",

The surveys include all data available through March 1, 1997. This includes the vast majority of ROSAT PSPC observations. Filter observations and observations taken during the verification phase in 1991 were not included in either set. The details of the generation of the surveys are discussed in a &amp;lt;a href=\"http://skyview.gsfc.nasa.gov/help/pspc_generation.html\"&amp;gt; companion document&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. Basically the counts and exposure from all observations were added and then an intensity map was generated as the ratio of the two. &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; The smaller cut-offs allow users to distinguish point sources in fields where a bright source may have been towards the edge of one observation and near the center of another. In these cases the source appears fuzzy due to the poor resolution of ROSAT near the edge of the field of view. This comes at the cost of a substantial reduction in the fraction of the sky covered. Counts and exposure maps are included for users who may need this information (&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;e.g.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;, to do statistical analysis). &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; The global organization of the surveys is similar to the IRAS survey. Each map covers an area of 2.5&amp;amp;amp;#176;x2.5&amp;amp;amp;#176; with a minimum overlap of 0.25&amp;amp;amp;#176;. To cover the entire sky would require over 10,000 maps. However due to lack of coverage only approximately 4000-6000 maps are actually populated. Users asking for reqions where there is no ROSAT coverage may get a blank region returned. &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; Detailed information regarding the creation of the ROSAT suveys can be found in the &amp;lt;a href=\"http://skyview.gsfc.nasa.gov/help/pspc_generation.html\"&amp;gt; ROSAT PSPC Generation Document&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.          https://skyview.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/sia.pl?survey=pspc1&amp;                               https://skyview.gsfc.nasa.gov\n",

More than 60,000 X-ray sources were detected during this time. &lt;p&gt; SkyView has multiple surveys derived from the RASS data. The surveys whose RASS are counts and exposure maps from the survey. Previously The RASSBCK maps have had the point sources removed to show the diffuse X-ray background and are presended at lower resolution. &lt;p&gt; The full-resolution RASS surveys data are organized in 1378 fields each 6.4&amp;amp;amp;#176; x 6.4&amp;amp;amp;#176; covering the whole sky. Neighboring fields overlap by at least 0.23&amp;amp;amp;#176;.&lt;p&gt; Three bands are available through &lt;i&gt;SkyView&lt;/i&gt; &lt;UL&gt; &lt;LI&gt; broad band (0.1-2.4 keV) &lt;LI&gt; hard band (0.5-2.0 keV) &lt;LI&gt; soft band (0.1-0.4 keV) &lt;/ul&gt; Data was dowloaded from the &lt;a href=\"http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/rosat/survey/rass-3/main/help.html#ftp\"&gt;MPE FTP site&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;p&gt; The intensity maps are created from the exposure maps using the single exposure map available which is appropriate for the broad band images, so the intensities of the hard and soft bands are only approximate.        https://skyview.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/sia.pl?survey=rassall&amp;                               https://skyview.gsfc.nasa.gov\n",

The maps cover approximately 98% of the sky. These maps have had all point sources removed These surveys supercede the RASS0.25, RASS0.75 and RASS1.5 Kev surveys previously provided. Those surveys may still be invoked in SkyView using batch and jar tools but are not accessible on the Web page. &lt;p&gt; The seven maps correspond to ranges in the pulse height analysis of the photons detected. Since the energy resolution of the PSPC is poor, there is consider overlap between adjacent bands. &lt;p&gt; The energy range for the bands corresponds to: &lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Band&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Energy range (keV)&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Band 1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;0.11 - 0.284&lt;/td&gt;&lt;tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Band 2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;0.14 - 0.284&lt;/td&gt;&lt;tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Band 3&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;0.2 - 0.83&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Band 4&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;0.44 - 1.01&lt;/td&gt;&lt;tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Band 5&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;0.56 - 1.21&lt;/td&gt;&lt;tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Band 6&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;0.73 - 1.56&lt;/td&gt;&lt;tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Band 7&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1.05 - 2.04&lt;/td&gt;&lt;tr&gt; &lt;/table&gt; Note the substantial overlap between bands. Each photon detected is assigned to a band based on the pulse height analysis for that photon, but the energy resolution of the detectors is relatively poor. Also note that Band 3 was not included in the reference paper due to poor statistics and background modeling. &lt;p&gt; SkyView has several other sets of surveys derived from ROSAT data with substantially higher resolution and which include point sources. The RASS surveys are derived from the RASS all sky survey. These include count and intensity maps. The PSPC maps are dervived from the PSPC pointed observations which were combined by SkyView. The HRI survey is derived from a similar mosaicking of all HRI observations.        https://skyview.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/sia.pl?survey=rassbck&amp;                               https://skyview.gsfc.nasa.gov\n",

These data were obtained in scanning mode and therefore an individual dataset covers a much larger area of the sky than do pointed moded observations. In addition all these data were obtained with PSPC-C, while all pointed mode observations after the end of the All-Sky Survey were obtained with PSPC-B. For each observation listed in this database table, the instrument used, processing site, and coordinates of the field center are given, as well as the ROSAT observation request number (ROR), actual exposure time, date the observation took place, and more.

In addition to the parameters returned by SASS (like position, count rate, signal-to-noise, etc.) each source in the table has associated with it a set of source and sequence &amp;quot;flags&amp;quot;. These flags are provided by the ROSAT data centers in the US, Germany and the UK to help the user of the ROSHRI database table quickly judge the reliability of a given source. The ROSHRI table excludes sources that meet the following parameter criteria: false_det = 'T' or deferred = 'T' or not_checked = 'T' or un_unique ='T'. See the documentation below for descriptions of these parameters.

See the documentation below for descriptions of these parameters. The catalog consists of all primary source parameters from the automated detection algorithm employed by the SASS. In addition each observation has been quality checked, both by automatic algorithms and by detailed visual inspection. The results of this quality checking are contained as a set of logical-value flags for a set of principal source parameters.

The mission was primarily designed to study the variability of X-ray sources on time scales from sub-milliseconds to years. The maneuvering capability of the satellite combined with the high photon throughput of its main detector (PCA) and high quality of background prediction (thanks to PCA intrumental group of LHEA, GSFC) has also made it possible to construct maps of the sky in energy band 3-20 keV. During its life time RXTE/PCA has collected a large amount of data from slew observations covering almost the entire sky. &lt;p&gt; We have utilized the slew parts of all RXTE/PCA observations performed from April 15, 1996-July 16, 2002 which amounts in total to approximately 50,000 observations. The exposure time at a given point in the map is typically between 200-500 seconds. The observational period before April 15, 1996 (High Voltage Epochs 1 and 2) was excluded from the analysis because during that time the PCA had significantly different gain and dependence of the effective area on energy. The data reduction was done using standard tools of the LHEASOFT with a set of packages written by M. Revnivtsev (HEAD/IKI, Moscow; MPA, Garching).&lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The survey has several features. It has strongly different exposure times at different points on the sky that lead to strong variability of the statistical noise on images. Because of that the only meaningful representation of images is the map in units of statistical significance. After the detection of a source flux can be determined from the map in the 'flux' units. Map resolution is determined mainly by the slew rate of the RXTE (&amp;amp;lt;0.05-0.1&amp;amp;amp;#176;;/sec) and the time resolution of used data (16 sec, Std2 mode of the PCA). Sources can be detected down to the level of ~6e&lt;sup&gt;-12&lt;/sup&gt; erg/s/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, but at this level the confusion starts to play an important role.

This atlas covers the southern hemisphere sky (declinations less than +15 degrees). The observations were taken with a robotic camera operating at Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO) in Chile. The atlas consists of 2168 images covering 542 fields. There are four images available for each field: &amp;lt;b&amp;gt;H-alpha&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Continuum&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Continuum-Corrected&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt; (the difference of the H-alpha and Continuum images), and &amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Smoothed&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt; (median filtered to 5 pixel, or 4.0 arcminute, resolution to remove star residuals better).

Astronomers can generate images of any portion of the sky at wavelengths in all regimes from radio to gamma-ray. Users tell SkyView the position, scale and orientation desired, and SkyView gives users an image made to their specification. The user need not worry about transforming between equinoxes or coordinate systesm, mosaicking submaps, rotating the image,.... SkyView handles these geometric issues and lets the user get started on astronomy.                           https://skyview.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/sia.pl?                               https://skyview.gsfc.nasa.gov\n",

As described in the reference abstract: This is a high-resolution radio survey of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Southern Equatorial Stripe, a.k.a., Stripe 82. This 1.4 GHz survey was conducted from 2007 to 2009 with the Very Large Array primarily in the A-configuration, with supplemental B-configuration data to increase sensitivity to extended structure. The survey has an angular resolution of 1.8\" and achieves a median rms noise of 53 microJy/beam over 92 square degrees. This is the deepest 1.4 GHz survey to achieve this large of an area filling in the phase space between small&amp;amp;amp;deep and large&amp;amp;amp;shallow surveys. &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; The astrometric accuracy of the data is excellent with errors in observed sources of 0.10\" in both RA and declination. A comparison with the SDSS DR7 Quasar Catalog confirms that the astrometry is well tied to the optical reference frame with mean offsets of 0.02+/-0.01\" in RA and 0.01+/-0.02 in declination.    https://skyview.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/sia.pl?survey=stripe82vla&amp;                               https://skyview.gsfc.nasa.gov\n",

The images from the SUMSS are produced as 4 x 4 degree mosaics of up to seventeen individual observations, to ensure even sensitivity across the sky. The mosaics slightly overlap each other. Data were last updated on January 28, 2015. &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; Images can also be obtained from the &amp;lt;a href=\"http://www.astrop.physics.usyd.edu.au/cgi-bin/postage.pl\"&amp;gt;SUMSS Postage Stamp Server&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; The SUMSS is intended to complement the NRAO-VLA Sky Survey (NVSS) which covered the sky between +90 and -40 deg declination, at a frequency of 1400MHz. &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;          https://skyview.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/sia.pl?survey=sumss&amp;                               https://skyview.gsfc.nasa.gov\n",

Each of the simultaneous modes is listed in separate records within this table. For a given time interval, there are several records (partially overlapping in time), each describing a single configuration/mode. The BAT modes collect data for the entire FOV but also have the capability to record rates (tag mask rate) for up to a few specific sky positions (typically 3) that correspond to a pre-assigned target ID. It is possible that at least two or more of these positions do not coincide with the BAT or NFI pointing position and therefore the target ID does necessarily coincide with Target_ID of the BAT or NFI pointing position. This table records for the position (RA and Dec) and Target_ID parameters the correct values associated to each of the mask tag data.           https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/xamin/vo/sia?table=swiftbalog&amp;  https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/swiftbalog.html\n",

Aimed at producing a reliable compact source survey, the automated data reduction pipeline efficiently processed more than 2000 hours of observations with minimal human interaction. Through application of innovative techniques such as image-based flagging, direction-dependent calibration of ionospheric phase errors, correcting for systematic offsets in antenna pointing, and improving the primary beam model, good quality images were created for over 95 percent of the 5336 pointings. This data release covers 36,900 square degrees (or 3.6 pi steradians) of the sky between -53 deg and +90 deg DEC, which is 90 percent of the total sky. The majority of pointing images have a background RMS noise below 5 mJy/beam with an approximate resolution of 25\" x 25\" (or 25\" x 25\" / cos (DEC - 19 deg) for pointings south of 19 deg DEC). The associated catalog has 640 thousand radio sources derived from an initial, high reliability source extraction at the 7 sigma level. The measured overall astrometric accuracy is better than 2\" in RA and DEC, while the flux density accuracy is estimated at ~10 percent. Data is stored as 5336 mosaic images (5 deg x 5 deg). &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;SkyView&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; uses Lanczos resampling and Sqrt image scaling by default for this survey.           https://skyview.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/sia.pl?survey=tgss&amp;                               https://skyview.gsfc.nasa.gov\n",

It will ultimately cover 7000 square degrees in the northern sky at both high and low Galactic latitudes and goes about three magnitudes deeper than 2MASS in the coverage area. Most data is taken in the J, H and K bands. A Y band is available in some regions. &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; UKIDSS is comprised of several distinct surveys in different regions of the sky. Of primary interest to &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;SkyView&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; users (since they have the largest sky coverage) are the Large Area Survey, the Galactic Plane Survey, and the Galactic Clusters Survey. There are deep and ultadeep surveys which cover much smaller fractions of the sky. The planned coverage for the UKIDSS surveys may be seen at the &amp;lt;a href='http://www.ukidss.org/surveys/surveys.html'&amp;gt; UKIDSS survey page&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. All UKIDSS data products are published by the Wide-Field Astronomy Unit (WFAU) at the University of Edinburgh through the &amp;lt;a href=http://surveys.roe.ac.uk/wsa&amp;gt;WFCAM Science Archive (WSA)&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; which includes more detailed coverage information for each data release. &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;SkyView&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; currently uses the DR8 data release except for the Galactic Plane Survey region where the DR7 is the latest public release. Many thanks to the WSA team at WFAU for providing an interface to make all the latest data easily accessed. Note that coverage is not uniform across the different bands so that at a given point there might be H and K band data, but nothing in the J band.         https://skyview.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/sia.pl?survey=ukidss&amp;                               https://skyview.gsfc.nasa.gov\n",

WISE achieved a 5 sigma point source sensitivities better and 0.08, 0.11 1 and 6 mJy in unconfused regions on the ecliptic in the four bands. Sensitivity improves toward the ecliptic poles due to denser coverage and lower zodaical background. &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; The WISE All-WISE includes all data taking during the WISE full cryogenic phase, from January 7, 2010 to August 6, 2010, that were processed with improved calibrations and reduction algorithms and combines this with the NEOWISE postcryogenic survey to form the most comprehensive view of the full mid-infrared sky. bibcode=1995ApJ...451..564V,2010ApJ...713..912W &amp;lt;hr&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; SkyView includes the four WISE bands as separate surveys. Many non-image data products are available at the WISE site. Note that WISE data is distributed in relatively large (&amp;amp;gt;50 MB) image files. When SkyView generates an image for a part of the sky where it has not yet cached the data from the IPAC server there may be a delay as full tiles are downloaded even when only a small fraction of a tile is needed. Images in cached regions, are generated much faster. Access to the WISE data uses the VO SIA interface maintained at IPAC. Even when data is cached, the SIA service must still be available for successful queries.           https://skyview.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/sia.pl?survey=wise&amp;                               https://skyview.gsfc.nasa.gov\n",

The original data are available at the &amp;lt;http://lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov&amp;gt;LAMBDA archive&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; The original data are stored in HEALPix pixels. SkyView treats HEALPix as a standard projection but assumes that the HEALPix data is in a projection plane with a rotation of -45 degrees. The rotation transforms the HEALPix pixels from diamonds to squares so that the boundaries of the pixels are treated properly. The special HealPixImage class is used so that SkyView can use the HEALPix FITS files directly. The HealPixImage simulates a rectangular image but translates the pixels from that image to the nested HEALPix structure that is used by the WMAP data. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;           https://skyview.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/sia.pl?survey=wmap&amp;                               https://skyview.gsfc.nasa.gov\n",

It is periodically updated as necessary. This database table contains the list of observations which have already been made by the XMM-Newton observatory, as well as those which are scheduled to be made in the near future (usually a a few weeks to a month ahead of the present). It does not contain observations which are scheduled to be performed further in the future, nor does it contain accepted observations which have not yet been scheduled. The list of all accepted XMM-Newton observations, including a number of ones which are unlikely to ever be carried out, such as accepted priority C targets, is available in the XMMAO Browse table. This table includes entries for both pointed data and for data obtained during spacecraft slews. The slew observations all have obsid values beginning with the digit 9 and, because they were not made at a fixed position, lack any positional information such as RA and Declination. Some XMM-Newton observations for which the archived data has become publicly available as indicated by the public_date parameter value, i.e., the proprietary period has expired, are not currently available at the HEASARC: such cases will have values of 'N' for the data_in_heasarc parameter. These datasets in most cases are available at the ESA XMM-Newton Science Archive (XSA) at http://nxsa.esac.esa.int/nxsa-web/ .
